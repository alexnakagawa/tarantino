# Tarantino Movie Training Model

When it comes to movies, it is difficult to talk about the historical fiction genre without mentioning the name [Quentin Tarantino](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/filmotype/director?ref_=m_nmfm_4). The man is the master of dialogue and violence. A perfect example of his craft can be shown below.

So amazing. One begs the question, **"How does this man generate critically-acclaimed movies as well as he does?"** To generalize, Tarantino's style relies heavily on characters who are bellicose in nature, either verbally or physically. Luckily, [FiveThirtyEight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com) has a public dataset on Github [here](http://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/tarantino), and has dedicated an entire [article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/complete-catalog-curses-deaths-quentin-tarantino-films/) to tracking every curse word and death in seven of Tarantino's best films.

I couldn't imagine that cursing or blood spill in a movie would contribute to a higher critic score, no matter how epic it seems. I decided to do some digging around to see what exactly _what_ caused this director's success.

### Setting Up

```{r more_setup, include=TRUE}
tarantino <- read.csv("/users/alexnakagawa/iXperience/tarantino/tarantino.csv")
# This is my local file path for the tarantino.csv dataset downloaded from FiveThirtyEight's GitHub!
```

The initial table named `tarantino` had `movie, type, word, & minutes_in` columns. I had several problems right off the bat.

1. Type had a binaural distinction, meaning that it could either be a `word` or `death`. If it was `death` in that row, that meant that the `word` column would be filled with a null value. The data was super messy.

2. There were no totals for the words and deaths. Also, there were no data on the ratings for each movie. I also needed columns that would show the box office revenue and the budget of each of the movies as well (explained later).

### Data Wrangling

So I got down to business.

```{r tables}
# Count how many entries there are for each movie, add movie rating for each one
movies <- count(tarantino, movie)
names(movies)[2] <- "total"
movies$RTrating <- c(88, 89, 87, 85, 84, 94, 90)     # Rotten Tomatoes rating
movies$budget <- c(100, 70, 12, 30, 30, 8.5, 1.2)    # The movie's budget, given in millions USD
movies$boxoffice <- c(425.4, 321.5, 74.7, 180.9, 152.2, 213.9, 2.8)  # Box office, given in millions USD
head(movies)
```

I now had a neater table with the Rotten Tomatoes score of each movie, as well as the total curse words and deaths, budget, and box office. I now shifted my attention to wrangling with the individual words deaths, which I then joined with my initial `movies` table. I also thought that it would be interesting to show the ratio between the deaths and curse words in each movie just for reference, because sometimes it is really difficult to keep track of just how much vulgarity is in Tarantino's movies.

```{r words and deaths}
# Separate by number of entries in each category
words <- filter(tarantino, type == 'word')
deaths <- filter(tarantino, type == 'death')
deaths <- deaths[-3]

# Find the total number of deaths and words in each movie
words_total <- group_by(words, movie) %>% summarise(n())
names(words_total)[2] <- "words_per_movie"
deaths_total <- group_by(deaths, movie) %>% summarise(n())
names(deaths_total)[2] <- "deaths_per_movie"

# Combine
movies <- left_join(movies, words_total, by = 'movie')
movies <- left_join(movies, deaths_total, by = 'movie')

# Add new ratio for the number of deaths to curse wordsa
movies$death_word_ratio <- deaths_total$deaths_per_movie / words_total$words_per_movie
new_data <- movies[order(movies$death_word_ratio), ]

summary(movies)
```
